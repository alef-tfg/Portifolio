#  Portifolio Repository

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio repository! This repository showcases some of the skills I have developed over the years as a physicist and data visualization enthusiast.

## Projects

### Macro analyses
As an overall data enthusiast, I've been tracking everything I eat for the last couple of years. Here, I present analyses of this data. Currently, there is only an exploratory analysis, but soon I will train a machine learning (ML) model to evaluate the quality of my eating habits. I will also create a Streamlit dashboard to visualize the data and the scores given by the ML algorithm.

###Resum√©
To demonstrate my HTML and CSS capabilities and to have a page with a better presentation of myself and my contacts, I've created this [simple webpage](alef-tfg.github.io).
