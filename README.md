#  Portifolio Repository

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio repository! This repository showcases some of the skills I have developed over the years as a physicist and data visualization enthusiast.

## Projects
### Macro analyses
As an overall data enthusiast, I've been tracking everything I eat for the last couple of years. Here, I present analyses of this data. Currently, there is only an exploratory analysis, but soon I will train a machine learning (ML) model to evaluate the quality of my eating habits. I will also create a Streamlit dashboard to visualize the data and the scores given by the ML algorithm.

## Skills and Technologies
- Languages: Python
- Frameworks: Streamlit 
- Tools: Git, VScode, JupyterLAB
